# Paper: Multimodal Models for Delisted Status Prediction Using Textual Disclosures
As the project is still progressing, I upload a brief discription of our paper related with enterprise risk managemnt and multimodal model. In the research, my mianly tasks were: 
 Conducted research on predicting the delisted status of companies by integrating financial indicators and textual disclosures of regulatory violations from Shanghai Stock Exchange; led 20+ group discussions and presented at the state level
	Utilized BERT for sentiment analysis and deep learning models for feature extraction and prediction on 16k+ datapoints; applied Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest and achieved an AUC of 0.92 to show high predicative accuracy
	Revealed negative sentiment and frequency of regulatory violations correlate with higher delisting risk and concluded that companies with frequent and severe violations, with negative sentiment in disclosures, had  higher probability of being delisted
